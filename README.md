This is an inprogress project to create a web-based utility for use in the creation of weapons, vehicles and starships using Fire, 
Fusion and Steel book with Traveller, The New Era.  The book uses a large number of tables and calculations, which can hamper gameplay.  
This web utility performs the calculations and table lookups based on user provided characteristics of the equipment they wish to
design.
